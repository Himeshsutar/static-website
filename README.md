# Static Website Hosted on GitHub Pages

This is a simple static website hosted using **GitHub Pages**. It demonstrates the basic steps to deploy a static HTML website and customize it with CSS.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file of the website.

- **styles.css**: The custom CSS file used to style the website.

## Steps to Host a Static Website on GitHub Pages

1. **Create the `index.html` file**:

   - The HTML file contains the structure of the website.

2. **Push to a New GitHub Repository**:

   - Create a new repository on GitHub and push the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   - Go to the repository settings, navigate to the **Pages** section, and select the `main` branch and the root folder.

4. **Access the Live Website**:

   - After enabling GitHub Pages, you can access the live website through the provided URL:

     ```
     https://yourusername.github.io/static-website/

     ```

5. **Customize the Website**:

   - Add a custom `styles.css` file to modify the look and feel of the website.

   - Modify the `index.html` file to add more content or structure.

## Customization with CSS

In this project, we added a simple `styles.css` file to customize the background color, text alignment, and font of the website. You can modify the CSS to further personalize the design.
